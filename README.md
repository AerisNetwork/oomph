# oomph
An interception based anti-cheat proxy.

## How does oomph work?
Oomph is a middle-man between your server and any minecraft clients that want to join. Oomph processes all client packets
for the server and runs multiple checks on each one to detect for any possible cheats.

This allows for oomph to run on any server software, unlike traditional anti-cheats which are only compatible with a
specific one.
